# Go Concurrency Examples In Detail

Welcome to the Go Concurrency Examples repository! This collection of code snippets and examples is designed to help you understand and implement concurrency in Go (Golang).

#### Information
This repository still under development. I will add more examples as I learn more about concurrency in Go.

## Introduction
Go is known for its powerful concurrency support through goroutines and channels. This repository aims to show Go's concurrency features and provide you with hands-on examples that cover a wide range of topics.

## Getting Started

To get started with these examples, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/oguzhantasimaz/Go-Concurrency-Examples-In-Detail.git
   ```
   
## Contributing

If you have additional examples, improvements, or corrections to existing code, please feel free to open a pull request.
Also feel free to customize this README.md file. 

### Notes
I strongly recommend you to research Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP). This is the theoretical basis of Go's concurrency model. I have added a link to the book below. You can also find a lot of resources on the internet.\

Even though defer is not a concurrency feature, I added a DeferWorkLogic folder to show you how defer works. I think it is a good idea to know how defer works before you start learning concurrency in Go.\

I also recommend checking out the VisualizeConcurrencyWithSVG folder. It is a good way to visualize concurrency in Go. For you to understand how it works, I added a README.md file to the folder. You can find more information there.
